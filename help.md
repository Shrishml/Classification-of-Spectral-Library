# Classification-of-Spectral-Library
We have used machine learning algorithms to classify CF and Jacobi library.
1. Program,'Training_machine_learning_algorithms.py' uses two files  'X.npy' and 'y.npy'  to train our algorithm for main classes and their subclasses  and  generate 3 output file for each algorithm.

2. Program,'Training_machine_learning_algorithms_luminosity.py' uses two files  'X.npy' and 'y_l.npy'  to train our algorithm for luminousity classes  generate 3 output file for each algorithm.

3.  Program ‘output_files_analysis.py’ analyses all the output data from above two program and saves a .csv file.
